- 👋 Hi, I’m @DTyler-Arine. I am an Algoriths Intern at Arine.
- 👀 I’m interested in NLP, Text Analysis, and LLM. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning *everything*, onboarding is like drinking from a firehose!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (whatever my boss tells me to do, right now, at least).
- 📫 How to reach me mtyler@arine.io
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/don't call me late for supper
- ⚡ Fun fact: The most common type of AI is an Expert System. Expert Systems help radiologists read xrays, doctors diagnose diseases, mechanics fix cars, and pilots fly airplanes. Expert Systems have been in use for decades. No one panics about expert systems or spawning terminators or taking over the world.
